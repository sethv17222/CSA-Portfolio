    <p>My name is Seth Vanderspek and I am a Senior at Rancho Bernardo High School. I am 17 years old from San Diego, California. I am part Dutch, but mostly just considered American. I am applying as a Mechanical Engineer for college next year because of my love for math and physics.</p>
    <h2 class="all-about-me-subhead">Hobbies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Baseball - I have been playing since I was 5 years old, and it is my biggest passion</li>
      <li>Golf - I started playing golf recently, but have a lot of fun especially because I find it more laid back and some similarities to baseball</li>
      <li>Video Games - I don't play super often, but I do enjoy a playing a few different kinds of games in my spare time with friends</li>
      <li>Traveling - I find it very interesting exploring new places around the world and trying different foods that come with that</li>
